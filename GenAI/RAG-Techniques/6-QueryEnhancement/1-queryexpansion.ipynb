    "In a RAG pipeline, the quality of the query sent to the retriever determines how good the retrieved context is — and therefore, how accurate the LLM’s final answer will be.\n",

    "It is especially useful when:\n",

    "- The original query is short, ambiguous, or under-specified\n",
    "- You want to broaden the scope to catch synonyms, related phrases, or spelling variants"

      "   • Planner – lays out strategy, timelines, and dependencies  \n",

      "   • Reviewer/Validator – checks quality and flags issues  \n",
      "\n",
      "2. Structured Collaboration  \n",
      "   • Unlike solitary autonomous agents, CrewAI’s agents pass work products and feedback along a chain of responsibility, ensuring each subtask is handled by the most appropriate specialist.  \n",
      "   • Communication channels and hand-off protocols are built into the system, so progress and context flow smoothly from one agent to the next.  \n",
      "\n",
      "3. Use Cases  \n",
      "   • Market Research – one agent mines data, another synthesizes findings, a third writes the report.  \n",
      "   • Legal Document Analysis – a specialist agent extracts clauses, another summarizes risks, a reviewer validates accuracy.  \n",
      "   • Product Development – ideation, prototyping, testing, documentation handled by distinct agents.  \n",
      "   • Coding Assistance – design, implementation, debugging, and code review split across agents.  \n",
      "\n",
      "By combining specialization (each agent does what it does best) with a clear, collaborative workflow, CrewAI agents can handle end-to-end, multi-stage tasks more efficiently and reliably than lone AI assistants.\n"
